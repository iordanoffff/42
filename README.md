# ft_linear_regression

## Goal of the project

The aim of this project is to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm

## How to use the script

Either you can import `research.py` or just run it in a shell.
* run it in a shell: it will train with the data of the project, and with the default arguments in our class. Then you will have two plots to show you the fitting and the evolution of the loss during the fitting
* import it: you must first create a class `fit_lin_reg`, run the function `train_model`. Then if you want to see the results, you just have to run the function `plot_result` and `plot_train_info`.
